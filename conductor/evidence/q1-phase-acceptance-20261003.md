# Q1 acceptance: checked resource lifecycle



Reviewed source commit: d8791ad981429f5b7d3c2238d0b034c04781488e on
codex/careops-resource-lifecycle. Independent read-only source review found no
Q1 acceptance blocker. Parent acceptance awaits exact-commit owner CI.

Coverage: opaque generational handles, authoritative ECS resource/request/work
state, typed owned context, ordered derived queue and active allocation indexes,
checked admission/counters, buffered manual release/capacity/removal/despawn,
canonical inspection, UInt32 lifecycle ordinals, standard Error/Display, and
missing-owner builder rejection before mutation. All owner claims are cancelled
before arbitration and owned work/context is removed in canonical order.
Seven related component/lease outputs were integrated by one coordinator writer;
intermediate interface drafts were never treated as runtime acceptance.

Executed at /private/tmp/careops-d2-main-acceptance-20261003/libs/kairos:
- cargo test --locked -p kairo-ecs-des: exit 0, 33 tests, current Rust/Cargo 1.98.1.
- cargo clippy --locked -p kairo-ecs-des --all-targets -- -D warnings: exit 0.
- rustup run 1.76.0 cargo test --locked -p kairo-ecs-des: exit 0, 33 tests.
- cargo deny --locked --workspace --all-features check: all four categories pass.
Logs retained in parent .artifacts/blocker-resolution/q1-final-native.log,
q1-final-clippy.log, q1-msrv-final.log and q1-policy-verified.log.
The seeded invariant grid uses 32 deterministic LCG seeds, 100 operations each;
no empirical input or RNG-core changes. Legacy FIFO tests remain unchanged.
Rust 1.76 evidence covers selected DES on macOS ARM64, not the whole workspace.

Dependency-policy repair: 37 internal path references in 18 manifests gained
exact target versions; Unicode-3.0 was added for unicode-ident's existing
compound licence. Ban/advisory/source restrictions retained. thiserror 2.0.20
was reviewed against the selected Rust floor and lockfile. Independent review
confirmed metadata-only effects outside the owned DES crate.
The initial policy repair packet had incomplete input hashes/unrelated steps.
Its original record was retained; a fresh all-input verification-only packet was
bound at a7e4249 and scope-specific checks were rerun. It is not represented as
an original correctly bound source dispatch.

Bound coordinator evidence packet: Q1.4.evidence.coordinator, task Q1.2 combines
the dependent Q1.2/Q1.3 review; prerequisites for parent Q1.4 remain pending.
Reviewed Q1 test/manual traces cover closed capacity, recycled owner, duplicate
release, stale events and failed commands without leaked claims.

Limits: this is experimental manual FIFO lifecycle. Priority/rekey/deadlines,
timed completion/preemption, hooks and persistent same-tick budgets belong to
Q2-Q4. Full-world per-dispatch staging cost remains a Q5 benchmark concern.
Trusted Rust context destructors are not panic-isolated. Portable codecs and
checkpoint/restore remain Track 22. No clinical validation or universal backend
support is claimed. No broad polyglot `just ci` execution is claimed.

Final reviewed Kairos bb09ba91c06c5e4e3c304a0a8cdef2fc03df00a8 passed exact native owner CI on both hosts: https://github.com/edithatogo/kairos/actions/runs/37084938990.
Phase gate and strict clean-tree git closeout both passed. Q1.1-Q1.4 accepted; Q2 onward remains pending.
